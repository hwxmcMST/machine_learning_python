    "Due to a rapid economic development, industrial expansion and urbanization during the last few decades in China,there has been a sharp increase in energy consumption. Official statistics indicate that China's total energy consumption increased from 1555 million tons in 2001 to 4260 million tons coal equivalent in 2014, representing a 1.7-fold increase since China joined the World Trade Organization in December 2001. This staggering increase in energy consumption accompanied with lax environmental regulations has led to severe and chronic respiratory diseases and potentially have lasting negative effects on agriculture, climate, ecosystem and many aspects of society.\n",

    "The increasingly occurrence of haze or smog episodes characterized by the PM2.5, PM10, sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels and reduced visibility has been reported in national-scale China especially in the most developed and high-populated city clusters such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shenyang. Some research show that the energy consumptions keep high levels in the developed cities in China, which will accelerate the emission of air polltants such as sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide into the air. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, little study shows the evidence between the air quality and industrial and economic development in China in the past few years. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to provide the insights into the air quality and pollutants with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and energy consumption (coal and petrol) in China. We will investigate the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, O3, CO and NO2 and overall Air Quality Index (AQI) in over three hundred cities of China based on three years’ data from January 2015 to December 2017. \n",
    "\n",
    "The major study consists (1) the occurrence length and percentage of air quality index in over three hundred Chinese cities from 2015-2017; (2) the distribution and trends of different air pollutants for major regions in four seasons; (3) the influence of different air pollutants on air quality index by regression analysis; (4) linking the air quality with the amount of energy consumed and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) through time series method; (5) predicting the trends of air quality index in the early 2018 based on past datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "The overall manuscripts are organized as follows. The first part is the introduction of the air pollution in China. The second part provides the data information and analyses on descriptive statistics on the percentage and duration of different air pollutants concentration ranges. The third portion compares features such as the mean concentration, 25th and 50th percentiles, variance,etc with the change of time. At last,  the regression analysis and prediction will be performed according to extracted features from the datasets. "
